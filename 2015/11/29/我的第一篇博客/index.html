<li>论文<br>Abstract：This study presents a new reference current estimation method using proposed robust extended complex Kalman filter<br>(RECKF) together with model predictive current (MPC) control strategy in the development of a three-phase shunt active power<br>filter (SAPF). A new exponential function embedded into the RECKF algorithm helps in the estimation of in phase fundamental<br>component of voltage (vh) at the point of common coupling considering grid perturbations such as distorted voltage, measurement<br>noise and phase angle jump and also for the estimation of fundamental amplitude of the load current (ih). The estimation of these<br>two variables (vh, ih) is used to generate reference signals for MPC. The proposed RECKF-MPC needs less number of voltage<br>sensors and resolves the difficulty of gain tuning of proportional–integral (PI) controller. The proposed RECKF-MPC approach is<br>implemented using MATLAB/SIMULINK and also Opal-RT was used to obtain the real-time results. The results obtained using<br>the proposed RECKF together with different variants of Kalman filters (Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF) and extended<br>complex KF (ECKF)) and PI controller are analysed both in the steady state as well as transient state conditions. From the<br>above experimentation, it was observed that the proposed RECKF-MPC control strategy outperforms over PI controller and<br>other variants of Kalman filtering approaches in terms of reference tracking error, power factor distortion and percentage total<br>harmonic distortion in the SAPF system.</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Introduction</p>
<p>Shunt active power filters (SAPFs) have become popular from<br>the research community over past 10 years. They have the<br>potential to offer controlled harmonic reduction and power<br>quality improvement on power systems. This gives them a<br>significant advantage when compared with other harmonic<br>correction techniques [1–5]. Passive shunt filters for<br>instance can introduce a resonance onto the power system<br>and they also have no current limit, therefore can become<br>overloaded if the supply voltage quality deteriorates.<br>To obtain efficient shunt active filter performance, the<br>source reference generation plays an important role because<br>of its simplicity and less time consuming in<br>implementation. External proportional–integral (PI)<br>controller loop is needed for regulation of dc bus voltage in<br>the method based on conventional unit vector [6]. Fryze<br>theory [7] requires both load current and source voltage<br>measurement for reference generation without the necessity<br>of PI controller loop. However, it needs more calculations<br>for implementation. The operation of the SAPF system<br>requires ac mains to supply real power needed to the load<br>and some losses (switching losses of devices, losses in the<br>reactor and dielectric losses of dc capacitor) in the SAPF.<br>Therefore the proposed reference source currents that are<br>used to decide the switching of the SAPF have two parts:<br>one is the real fundamental-frequency component of the<br>load current, which is estimated using the proposed robust extended complex Kalman filter (RECKF), and another<br>component, which corresponds to the losses in the SAPF, is<br>also estimated using our proposed RECKF over the dc<br>voltage of SAPF. The advantage of this method is the<br>simplicity of calculus, avoidance of tuning methods and<br>the reduced number of voltage sensors necessary to obtain<br>the current reference. The reason for using this approach<br>is to eliminate relatively large overshoots and undershoots<br>associated with conventional PI controls, which may disturb<br>the stable operation of the inverter in protecting the<br>switching devices. Furthermore, recent applications need<br>faster response, minimum power dissipation and robustness,<br>which the PI controller fails to satisfy. Thus it is expected<br>that our proposed reference generation can overcome the<br>demerits of PI control and makes the dc-link capacitor<br>voltage steady at about set point.</p>
<p>However, if the fundamental component is not estimated<br>accurately, the active filter will source or sink the active<br>power. Among the several estimation methods [8–14], both<br>linear and extended Kalman filtering approaches have<br>attracted widespread attention, as they accurately estimate<br>the amplitude, phase and frequency of a signal buried with<br>noise and harmonics. Owing to the dynamic nature of<br>power system, the estimation method chosen must be<br>capable of rejecting grid perturbations such as harmonics,<br>voltage distortion, phase angle jump and measurement<br>noise. The aforesaid estimation approaches have not<br>considered these grid perturbations and hence in view of addressing these above issues (harmonics, voltage distortion,<br>noise), we focus on the development of a new estimation<br>algorithm (RECKF), in which a weighted exponential<br>function e−(y−h(x))2<br>has been incorporated considering all the<br>above grid perturbations to estimate the reference current in<br>SAPF. With arising abnormal condition, the value of ‘y − h<br>(x)’ increases faster because of inclusion of a ‘square’ term<br>in the proposed function, as a result the influences of<br>abnormality can be decreased at a faster rate as compared<br>with the exponential function mentioned earlier in [15, 16]<br>and hence the proposed RECKF approach provides<br>improved estimation which is independent of all grid<br>perturbations.</p>
<p>Successful control of active filters requires an accurate<br>current control scheme in addition with reference<br>generation. Implementation of new and more complex<br>control techniques, for example, sliding mode, fuzzy,<br>adaptive and predictive control have been possible with the<br>development of powerful and fast microprocessors.<br>Particularly, model predictive current (MPC) [17–20] has<br>demonstrated to offer a very simple and effective alternative<br>to classical control algorithms with pulse width modulation<br>for controlling the gate signals. The MPC approach takes<br>advantage of the limited number of switching states of<br>voltage source inverter (VSI) for solving optimisation<br>problem. A discrete model is used to predict the behaviour<br>of the system for every admissible actuation sequence up to<br>the prediction horizon. The switching action that minimises<br>a predefined cost function is finally selected to be applied in the next sampling instant. The main advantage of MPC lies<br>in the direct application of the control action to the inverter,without requiring a modulation stage.</p>
<p>With aforementioned views our proposed RECKF-MPC<br>approach is expected to be a better control strategy in SAPF<br>system. This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, the<br>mathematical model of the SAPF is presented, followed by<br>the explanation of the current controller scheme and<br>proposed reference generation algorithms in Sections 3 and<br>4, respectively. A brief description of Opal-RT real-time<br>platform is mentioned in Section 5. To assess the<br>performance of the proposed control scheme, extensive<br>simulation results are presented in Section 6 and verified by<br>real-time Opal-RT Lab. Finally, the conclusion is<br>summarised in Section 7.</p>
<p>2 Development of SAPF<br>The SAPF (Fig. 1a) can be controlled to compensate the<br>power factor (PF) and the ac line isabc current harmonics<br>introduced by non-linear load (the three-phase diode bridge<br>rectifier). The SAPF consists of a VSI, whose dc side is<br>connected to a capacitor bank C, whereas its ac side is<br>connected to the mains through a series impedance Lf, Rf to<br>inject currents ifabc to cancel the harmonic component<br>currents of the non-linear load.</p>
<p>2.1 Inverter model<br>The power circuit of VSI is shown in Fig. 1b, in which the<br>presences of line impedance (Ls, Rs) and of the load (LL,<br>RL) are neglected. The switching state of the inverter can be<br>described by variables Sa, Sb and Sc, which can take values<br>of 1 (ON state) or 0 (OFF STATE). Since there are three<br>phases with two possible switching states each, there are a<br>total of 23 = 8 different switching states. The space vector of switching state and the inverter voltage are defined by(1)and (2), respectively</p>
<p>where a = ej(2π/3) and van, vbn and vcn are the phase to neutral<br>(n) voltages. Thus, the inverter voltage vector can be related<br>with switching state vector by the equation</p>
<p>where vdc is the dc-link voltage and by evaluating each of the<br>switching states in (3), eight voltage vectors (v0 − v7) can be<br>generated by the inverter, as shown in Fig. 1c. Applying<br>Kirchhoff’s voltage law in Fig. 2a</p>
<p>where x represents the phases a, b and c and v is the voltage<br>generated by inverter. The source electro motive force (EMF)<br>is given by vs.</p>
<p>2.2 Discrete time model<br>A discrete time form of (4) for a sampling time Ts can be used to predict the future value of the current ‘iabc’ with the voltage and measured current at the kth sampling instant</p>
<p>Replacing ix(k + 1) by the reference value ix (k + 1) in (5), the source EMF can be estimated as where vˆsx(k) is the estimated value of vsx(k) and this<br>estimation uses the present value of applied source voltage<br>and the measured value of the source current.</p>
<p>3 Model predictive current (MPC) control<br>The main characteristic of this control strategy is the selection of the voltage vector that minimises a quality function g and this measures the error of the source current at the next sampling instant (k + 1). The quality function is expressed in orthogonal coordinates in the following form</p>
<p>where ipa and ipb are the real and imaginary parts of the<br>predicted source current ix(k + 1), i∗a and i∗b are the real and imaginary parts of future reference current. The source<br>reference generation methods are described in Section 4.<br>Fig. 1d shows the block diagram of model predictive<br>controller. Actual values of source current (ISabc) are<br>measured at instant k and used as input for a predictive<br>model that computes the values of the current at the next<br>sampling time for each of the possible switching states of the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter. These<br>predictions are evaluated with the quality function (7) and<br>the vector that minimises this function is applied during the<br>next sampling interval. The switching state could be<br>changed only once at each sampling instant.</p>
<p>4 Proposed reference current generation<br>Our proposed reference current generation is simply<br>modulation of the estimated fundamental amplitude of the<br>load current with the estimated in phase fundamental component of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage in pu<br>value. The merit behind this reference generation is the<br>avoidance of external PI controller loop, hence it becomes<br>cost effective. Four Kalman algorithms (KF, extended KF<br>(EKF), extended complex KF (ECKF) and proposed<br>RECKF) are applied here for estimation of the fundamental<br>component along with its magnitude from the observed<br>signal.</p>
<p>4.1 Formulation of KF algorithm approach to<br>reference current generation A linear signal zk of single sinusoid is represented by zk = a1 sin(kv1Ts + f1) k = 1, … , N (8a) v1 = 2pf1 (8b) In (8), Ts is the sampling time, parameters a1 and f1 are the fundamental amplitude and frequency, respectively, with initial phase j1. The signal zk + 1 can be expressed as</p>
<p>where x2k is known as the in quadrature component and is<br>orthogonal to x1k and they are represented by</p>
<p>To model amplitude or phase variations in the signal, a<br>perturbation vector g1 g2<br> T<br>k in the system states is<br>considered. The state space representation of the signal then</p>
<p>5 Real-time OPAL-RT platform<br>The RT-LAB simulator [21, 22] enables the parallel simulation of<br>power drives and electric circuits on clusters of PC running quick<br>UNIX (QNX) or RT-Linux operating systems. Using standard<br>SIMULINK models, RT–LAB builds computation and<br>communication tasks necessary to make parallel simulation of<br>electrical systems with standard PCs and communication links.<br>The Opal-RT allows developers to prove their ideas, prototypes<br>and final products in a realistic environment. It is a fully digital<br>power system simulator performing electromagnetic transient<br>power system simulations with a typical time step of 50 µs<br>with a combination of custom software and hardware. It is an<br>ideal tool for the design, development and testing of power<br>system protection and control schemes.<br>Fig. 2a shows the real-time simulation machine and its<br>console monitor. The results are observed in a digital<br>storage oscilloscope, which is connected to RT-Lab<br>simulator via connecting probes. The OP5142 displayed in<br>Fig. 2b is one of the key building blocks in the modulator<br>OP5000 I/O system from Opal-RT Technologies. The<br>incorporation of field programmable gate array (FPGA)<br>technologies in RT-Lab simulation clusters are allowed for<br>distributed execution of hardware description language<br>functions and high-speed digital I/O in real-time models. S1<br>is connected to master reset signal of OP5142 board and<br>this sends a reset signal to all OP5142 subsystems. JTAG1<br>gives access to OP5142 joint test action group (JTAG)<br>chain and its use is to configure the flash memory with its<br>default configuration file. Depending on the ‘JUMP4’<br>jumper presence, this interface may give access to both<br>FPGA and complex programmable logic device (CPLD)<br>configurations. If ‘JUMP4’ jumpers are set to independent<br>mode, JTAG2 gives access to CPLD JTAG configuration<br>interface. JTAG connection enables users to programme<br>manually the programmable components on the board.<br>JTAG3 gives access to the peripheral component interconnect express bridge JTAG interface. JP1 implements<br>all data and power transfers needed to be done with<br>external load. J1, J2 and J3 exchange all I/O-related data to<br>I/O module, including identification data, serial<br>communication with inter-integrated circuit (I2C) devicesand user I/O dataflow.</p>
<p>6 Simulation and OPAL-RT results<br>The proposed control strategy shown in Fig. 1a has been<br>tested using MATLAB/SIMULINK. A balanced three-phase<br>voltage supply has been applied to a typical non-linear load<br>composed of a three-phase diode rectifier bridge feeding an<br>RL load. The simulation parameters of SAPF are given in<br>Table 1, where Ls and Rs correspond to the source<br>impedances, Lf and Rf correspond to the filter impedances,<br>vs is the source voltage, v<br>∗<br>dc is the reference dc-link voltage,<br>C is the capacitance of dc bus, f is the system frequency,<br>fsw is the switching frequency of inverter and Ts is the<br>system sampling time.<br>Four control strategies namely KF-MPC, EKF-MPC,<br>ECKF-MPC and RECKF-MPC-based SAPF were implemented and analysed with conventional PI controller for<br>phase A using the following simulation and Opal-RT results.<br>For convenience, the initial state variables x0 were chosen to<br>be 0.0, and the filtered error covariance matrix P0 was selected to be diagonal with the value of 10 pu2. The measurement error covariance matrix R0 was selected to be 1.0 pu2 to represent an inaccurate measurement and the process error covariance matrix Q0 is fixed to be 0.001 pu2. The<br>covariance matrices P0 and R0 will be updated during the<br>estimation process.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows the steady-state results of capacitor voltage and compensating current in SAPF with different variants of<br>Kalman filters (KF, EKF, ECKF and RECKF) and conventional PI controller using MATLAB and Opal-RT. It is found that a large fluctuation of voltage has occurred across the dc capacitor in case of EKF and it is quickly set at about 250 V in case of RECKF as compared with other methods. In case of compensating current, RECKF approach exhibits best performance with smoother response than PI controller. The corresponding Opal-RT results compare well with the detailed simulation results. Load current response for SAPF in steady state is provided in Fig. 4.</p>
<p>Fig. 5 gives the MATLAB and Opal-RT details of response<br>of source current with the reference current and source current with source voltage after compensation for above Kalman algorithms and PI controller in steady state. The<br>compensation effects of different variants of Kalman<br>approaches (KF, EKF, ECKF and RECKF) along with PI ontroller in steady state are represented in Fig. 6. The gains of the PI controller (KP and KI) are tuned first for a (R = 50 Ω and L = 40 mH) non-linear load in accordance with the criterion of the Ziegler–Nichols tuning method, which tunes the gain values until the system yields a better result. Finally, the gains KP and KI are tuned about 0.35 and 0.08, respectively. From Fig. 6 it is clear that the total rmonic distortion (THD) of the source current is reduced from 24.9 to 4.79, 4.92, 4.63, 4.46 and 4.65% for KF, EKF, ECKF, RECKF and PI-MPC-based SAPF, respectively,which are below the mark of 5% specified in IEEE-519 standard. The proposed RECKF-MPC-based SAPF has yielded the lowest THD (4.46%) and has better compensation effect as compared with PI-MPC (4.65%) in steady state. </p>
<p>From the steady-state response, our proposed RECKF is<br>found to be the best among the four KF [23, 24]<br>algorithms, but slightly better than conventional PI<br>controller. To further assess the performance of our proposed RECKF with conventional PI controller, the<br>transient test analyses were performed in the SAPF system.<br>Figs. 7 and 8 show the transient responses of load current,<br>capacitor voltage, compensating current and source current<br>after compensation for a comparative study between<br>proposed RECKF and PI controllers with MATLAB and<br>Opal-RT platform, respectively. For transient state (sudden<br>change in load from R = 50 Ω, L = 40 mH to R = 30 Ω, L =<br>30 mH) condition, the step time is applied between 0.15<br>and 0.3 s. As shown in Fig. 7b, the capacitor voltage<br>suddenly settles (≃0.02 s) to set point even in transient<br>condition in case of our proposed RECKF, whereas it takes<br>(≃0.05 s) to reach the set point in case of PI controller. The<br>compensating current is smoother in case of RECKF as<br>compared with PI controller as given in Fig. 7c. As shown<br>in Fig. 7d, although the source current waveforms of both<br>RECKF and PI controller are always sinusoidal even when<br>subjected to a changing non-linear load, the source current<br>waveforms of the RECKF are fine and smoother than that<br>of the PI. The results obtained from the real-time simulator,<br>Opal-RT are shown in (Fig. 8), which are in close<br>agreement with the simulation results (Fig. 7).</p>
<p>Fig. 9 shows the comparison of the compensation effects<br>for both the PI-MPC and RECKF-MPC-based SAPF system<br>in steady state as well as transient states. For PI-MPC-based<br>SAPF, the source current THD is reduced from 24.9%<br>(without SAPF) to 4.65% (steady state) and 5.32%<br>(transient state). The PF is improved from 0.65 (without<br>SAPF) to 0.99 (steady state) and 0.98 (transient state).<br>However, the system performance becomes worst if load<br>changes. On the other hand, the same tests were performed,<br>except that the proposed RECKF approach is used instead<br>of the PI one. The source current THD is dropped to about<br>4.46% (steady state) and 4.67% (transient state) in case of<br>RECKF. PI control gains are tuned for steady-state<br>condition to obtain the best response. When the transient</p>
<p>state occurs, the gains of the PI controller cannot ensure<br>that the system has same response because of the lack of<br>adaptability. However, in RECKF-MPC-based SAPF<br>systems, a considerable flexibility is achieved to the<br>designer to alter the goals by quickly modifying the<br>weighted exponential function under abnormal condition<br>(i.e. change from steady to transient condition). Hence,<br>RECKF-MPC approach can assure the system stability.</p>
<p>7 Conclusions<br>In this paper, a model predictive-based SAPF with a new<br>reference current estimation scheme has been presented.<br>This scheme exploits the estimation of in phase fundamental<br>component of distorted PCC voltage along with the<br>estimation of fundamental amplitude of load current using<br>KF, EKF, ECKF and proposed RECKF algorithms. The<br>proposed RECKF algorithm is based on applying a new<br>weighted exponential function as a factor to limit the<br>variation of innovation vector, to restrain the unusual<br>measured value and to enhance the estimated accuracy with<br>consideration of grid perturbations such as voltage<br>distortion, measurement noise and phase angle jump. MPC<br>strategy presented in this paper is very simple and powerful<br>and advantageously considers the discrete nature of power converters. In addition, it is not necessary to include any<br>type of modulator and the drive signals for the IGBTs are<br>generated directly by this control. The proposed<br>RECKF-MPC control strategy avoids the use of external<br>linear and non-linear controllers; hence a cheaper control<br>strategy can be implemented while high performance is<br>maintained. The performances of the proposed<br>RECKF-MPC-based SAPF have been verified both in<br>steady state and transient state conditions. The proposed<br>RECKF approach overcomes difficulties encountered with<br>the fixed-gain PI controller, such as flexibility and<br>robustness over stabilisation of capacitor voltage when<br>changing loads.<br>Determination of current reference and current controller<br>for SAPF is one of the most important issues in<br>improvement of power quality. From the real-time and<br>simulation results, it is observed that RECKF-MPC exhibits<br>excellent tracking performance thus is a better control<br>approach to SAPF design in steady state as well as transient<br>state condition which improves power quality more<br>effectively in terms of efficient harmonics mitigation, power<br>factor improvement and tracking error reduction in presence<br>of above all grid perturbations.</p>
